# Installation

FicusJS script loader can be installed in a number of ways.

## CDN

We recommend using native ES modules in the browser.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { loadScript } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@ficusjs/script@2'
</script>
```

FicusJS script loader is available on [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/view/@ficusjs/script).

## NPM

FicusJS script loader works nicely with build tools such as Webpack or Rollup. If you are using a NodeJS tool, you can install the NPM package.

```bash
npm install @ficusjs/script
```

## Available builds

FicusJS script loader is only available as an ES module. For legacy browsers or alternative modules such as CommonJS, it is recommended to use a build tool to transpile the code.

The following builds are available.

- [Script](script) `dist/script.js`
