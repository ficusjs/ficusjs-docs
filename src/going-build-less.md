# Going build-less

Browsers have improved a lot over the past years. It's now possible to do web development without requiring any build tools, using the native module loader of the browser. We think this is a great fit for FicusJS, and we recommend this as a general starting point.

Build tools can quickly add a lot of complexity to your code, and make your code reliant on a specific build setup. We think it's best to avoid them during development, or only add them for light transformations if you know what you're doing.

[Read this article](https://dev.to/open-wc/developing-without-a-build-1-introduction-26ao) to learn more about this approach.

If your project is using an existing build tool, FicusJS is fully compatible and can work alongside other libraries and frameworks.
