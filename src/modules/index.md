# Modules

Components by nature should be re-used.

This is easy when the component will only be used within a single application.
How can you write a component once and use it in multiple applications?

A set of components can be shared as a module using a package manager or publishing it to a URL.

By packaging your components into a module, it can be imported into other applications and re-used multiple times.
