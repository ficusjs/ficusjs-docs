# Router

For multiple page applications, this simple client-side router is responsible for traversing a list of routes, finding the first matching route by string path, rendering any HTML returned from that route's action method into an outlet within the application.

## Aligns with standards

FicusJS router aligns with standard browser APIs which means it is not based on any proprietary code or libraries.

As it is based on standards, it has longevity and is a good choice for enterprise web applications.
